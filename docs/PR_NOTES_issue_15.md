PR Title: docs: add flowchart and kanban board for issue #15

Description:
- Added `docs/flowchart.svg` — a high-level flowchart showing main screens and navigation.
- Added `docs/kanban-board.md` — a lightweight Kanban board template for project tasks.
- Updated `README.md` to include the flowchart and a link to the Kanban doc.

How to review:
- Open `docs/flowchart.svg` in the browser or GitHub file view to verify the image.
- Check `docs/kanban-board.md` for clarity.
- Confirm README rendering includes the image.

Notes:
- Issue #15 requires an image before merging — this PR provides one.
- If maintainers prefer a different diagram style, I can provide PNG or edit the SVG.

Screenshot:
- When creating the PR, include a screenshot of `docs/flowchart.svg` in the PR description (or GitHub will render it automatically).
