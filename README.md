# 🚀 Code Brahma

**Code Brahma** is a **Jetpack Compose Android app** designed to create a **developer learning hub**.  
Think of it as a **community-driven space** where coders can:  
- Learn from curated courses 📚  
- Track progress & appear on leaderboards 🏆  
- Log in with GitHub 🔐 to showcase their dev identity  

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)

### 📌 Phase 1 – Core UI (Frontend Only)
- 🔐 **GitHub OAuth Login** (fetch GitHub profile: name, avatar, username)  
- 🏆 **Leaderboard Screen** – shows top coders (mock data first, later real data)  
- 📚 **Courses Screen** – curated list of coding courses/resources  
- 🏠 **Dashboard Screen** – quick links (Leaderboard, Courses, Profile)  

### 📌 Phase 2 – Data Integration
- ☁️ **GitHub API integration** → fetch user contributions/stats  
- 📂 **Course progress tracking** (local Room database)  
- 📊 **Leaderboard update** (based on progress or GitHub metrics)  

### 📌 Phase 3 – Community Features
- 👥 **Friends / Peers list** (other GitHub users in the app)  
- 🔔 **Reminders / Notifications** (daily coding streaks)  
- 🌎 **Global Leaderboard** (based on GitHub activity)
