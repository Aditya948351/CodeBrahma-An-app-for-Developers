# How to contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Go to the GitHub page of the original "CodeBrahma-An-app-for-Developers" repository.
   - Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner. This creates a copy under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   - On your forked repo page, click the **"Code"** button and copy the URL.
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CodeBrahma-An-app-for-Developers.git
     cd CodeBrahma-An-app-for-Developers 
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch**
   - Always make changes on a separate branch (not `main`).
     ```
     git checkout -b <your-branch-name (eg: feature/enhancemed-something)> 
     ```

4. **Make Your Changes**
   - Edit, add, or delete files as needed using your favorite code editor.

5. **Stage and Commit Changes**
   - Add the files you changed:
     ```
     git add . (or git add <the-files-you-have-edited>)
     ```
   - Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
     ```
     git commit -m "A brief description about what you have changed, deleted or added"
     ```

6. **Push Your Changes**
   - Push the branch to your fork:
     ```
     git push origin <your-branch-name>
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Go to your forked repo on GitHub.
   - Click **"Compare & pull request"** next to your recently pushed branch.
   - Add a title and description explaining your changes.
   - Click **"Create pull request"**.

8. **Respond to Feedback**
   - Project maintainers may ask for changes.
   - Make changes locally, commit, and push again — your PR (Pull Request) will update automatically.
